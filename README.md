# ClientChatSystem

A CRUD Interface I created to build a customer service database record of inquiries and associated answers. Incorporated the creation of a website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with subsequent use of CRUD to build out the interface. I'm not including the HTML or CSS code, but I am including the server.js code so the framework it was built on can be understood. In addition, I have linked a youtube video underneath that showcases the functionality of both the website and client chat system, so please be sure to check it out. Also, please note all sensitive information such as MongoDB server, message-key, and delete-key have been changed to preserve security. Thanks for checking my repo, have a great day!
